## 1. RPA Leaderboards

### RPA — Clean Audio ↑

Raw Pitch Accuracy on clean (no-noise) test clips. Higher is better.

| Rank | Student | RPA Clean ↑ | RPA +0 dB | RPA -5 dB | VAD Acc | Median Err | Note |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Festus Ewakaa Kahunla | 97.1% | 92.0% | 87.9% | 79.9% | 3.4¢ | Fixed train/eval label mismatch: VAD target now derived from f0>0 (RMVPE) instead of the RMS-energy vad label, which disagrees with RMVPE on 12.1% of frames. Added cosine annealing LR (CosineAnnealingWarmRestarts, T_0=10, T_mult=2, eta_min=1e-5). Reduced Viterbi onset penalty from 2.0 to 1.0. Trained 100 epochs from scratch (50 + 50 resume). |

| 3 | Charis NoiseAugBaseline | 96.6% | 88.8% | 87.8% | 97.3% | 12.1¢ | Baseline run with default hyperparameters, and the baseline noise augmentation (gru_size=96, cond_size=64, lr=1e-3). |
| 4 | Dillon Positive Weight | 95.4% | 89.1% | 91.3% | 97.7% | 10.6¢ | Applied recommended augmentation w/ 25% chance of clean output and applied 0.6x weight to stop the model from over-favoring voiced predictions. |
| 5 | Charis Test | 94.8% | 87.3% | 88.0% | 98.3% | 6.5¢ | Baseline run with default hyperparameters (gru_size=96, cond_size=64, lr=1e-3). |

| 7 | Stefan Snyder - Baseline | 91.1% | 85.4% | 81.0% | 98.4% | 13.0¢ | Baseline run with default hyperparameters, and the baseline noise augmentation (gru_size=96, cond_size=64, lr=1e-3). |
| 8 | Charis - Noise Augmentation v2 | 90.1% | 86.3% | 88.4% | 95.8% | 18.0¢ | Baseline run with default hyperparameters, with the basic noise augmentation and clean signal 10% of the time (gru_size=96, cond_size=64, lr=1e-3). |

### RPA — Macro Average (all SNR conditions) ↑
