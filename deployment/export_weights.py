Export NanoPitch PyTorch weights to JSON format for WASM deployment.

WHY DO WE NEED THIS SCRIPT?

Neural networks for audio (pitch detection, voice activity detection, etc.)
are typically trained in Python using PyTorch or TensorFlow. But for real-time
audio applications in the browser — like a web-based guitar tuner, a vocal
pitch monitor, or a DAW plugin — we need the model to run as WebAssembly (WASM)
compiled from C code. The browser cannot directly load a PyTorch .pth file.

This script bridges the gap: it reads a trained PyTorch model checkpoint and
writes out all the learned weight values as a simple JSON file. The JSON is
then loaded by JavaScript in the browser, which passes the raw float array
to the C/WASM inference engine via nanopitch_load_weights().

HOW PYTORCH STORES MODEL WEIGHTS (state_dict)

When you train a neural network in PyTorch, the learned parameters (weights
and biases) live inside nn.Module objects. PyTorch provides model.state_dict(),
which returns an OrderedDict mapping string names to tensors:

    {
        'conv1.weight': tensor of shape [64, 40, 3],
        'conv1.bias':   tensor of shape [64],
        'gru1.weight_ih_l0': tensor of shape [288, 96],
        ...
    }

Each key is "layer_name.parameter_name". The naming convention for built-in
layers is:
    - Conv1d:  "weight" and "bias"
    - GRU:     "weight_ih_l0", "weight_hh_l0", "bias_ih_l0", "bias_hh_l0"
    - Linear:  "weight" and "bias"

The "_l0" suffix means "layer 0" because nn.GRU supports stacking multiple
layers; we use single-layer GRUs so it is always _l0.

THE JSON FORMAT

The output JSON looks like this:

    {
        "format": "nanopitch_v1",
        "cond_size": 64,
        "gru_size": 96,
        "n_mels": 40,
        "pitch_bins": 360,
        "n_weights": 302857,
        "weights": [0.0123, -0.456, 0.789, ...]   <-- ALL weights as one flat list
    }

The browser loads this with fetch() or FileReader, JSON.parse()s it, then
copies the "weights" array into the WASM linear memory (HEAPF32) and calls
nanopitch_load_weights(ptr, n, cond_size, gru_size), which simply assigns
pointers into the flat buffer. No copying on the C side — just pointer
arithmetic.

Layout order (MUST match C's nanopitch_load_weights):
    conv1_weight, conv1_bias,
    conv2_weight, conv2_bias,
    gru1_w_ih, gru1_w_hh, gru1_b_ih, gru1_b_hh,
    gru2_w_ih, gru2_w_hh, gru2_b_ih, gru2_b_hh,
    gru3_w_ih, gru3_w_hh, gru3_b_ih, gru3_b_hh,
    dense_vad_weight, dense_vad_bias,
    dense_pitch_weight, dense_pitch_bias

Conv weights are stored as [out_channels][in_channels][kernel_size]
to match C's row-major indexing.

    === WHY A FLAT ARRAY? ===

    The C inference engine (nanopitch.c) expects all weights packed into one
    contiguous float* buffer. The C function nanopitch_load_weights() walks
    through this buffer with a moving pointer, assigning each section to the
    corresponding layer:

        const float *p = data;
        w->conv1_weight = p;  p += cond_size * 40 * 3;
        w->conv1_bias   = p;  p += cond_size;
        ...

    If we put the weights in the wrong order, or flatten a tensor in the wrong
    memory layout, the C code will read garbage values and the model will
    produce nonsense. This is the most critical part of the export pipeline.

    === ORDER MUST MATCH C's nanopitch_load_weights() ===

    The C code reads weights in this exact order:
        1. conv1 weight + bias

    #
    # HOW CONV1D WEIGHTS ARE SHAPED IN PYTORCH:

    # weight tensor with shape:
    #
    #     [out_channels, in_channels, kernel_size]
    #

    #     weight shape = [64, 40, 3]
    #     bias shape   = [64]
    #
    # This means: for each of the 64 output filters, there is a 2D kernel of
    # size [40, 3] that slides across the time axis. The 40 corresponds to the
    # 40 mel frequency bands (input channels), and 3 is the temporal receptive
    # field (3 frames = 30ms at 10ms hop).
    #
    # When we call .flatten(), PyTorch uses row-major (C-contiguous) order by
    # default, which means the innermost dimension (kernel_size) varies fastest.
    # This matches C's row-major array indexing:
    #     weight[o][i][k] in C  <==>  weight[o * in_ch * kern + i * kern + k]
    #
    # So .numpy().flatten() produces exactly the memory layout C expects.

    # ── GRU Weights ──
    #
    # HOW GRU WEIGHTS ARE ORGANIZED IN PYTORCH:
    #
    # A GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit) has three internal gates:
    #     r = reset gate    (decides how much of the previous hidden state to forget)
    #     z = update gate   (decides how much to update the hidden state)
    #     n = new gate      (the candidate hidden state to blend in)
    #
    # The standard GRU equations are:
    #     r_t = sigmoid(W_ir @ x_t + b_ir + W_hr @ h_{t-1} + b_hr)
    #     z_t = sigmoid(W_iz @ x_t + b_iz + W_hz @ h_{t-1} + b_hz)
    #     n_t = tanh(W_in @ x_t + b_in + r_t * (W_hn @ h_{t-1} + b_hn))
    #     h_t = (1 - z_t) * n_t + z_t * h_{t-1}
    #
    # Rather than storing 6 separate weight matrices (W_ir, W_iz, W_in for
    # input, and W_hr, W_hz, W_hn for hidden), PyTorch concatenates the three
    # gate matrices into two large matrices:
    #
    #     weight_ih = [W_ir]    shape: [3*hidden_size, input_size]
    #                 [W_iz]     (stacked vertically: r, z, n gates)
    #                 [W_in]
    #
    #     weight_hh = [W_hr]    shape: [3*hidden_size, hidden_size]
    #                 [W_hz]
    #                 [W_hn]
    #
    #     bias_ih = [b_ir, b_iz, b_in]   shape: [3*hidden_size]
    #     bias_hh = [b_hr, b_hz, b_hn]   shape: [3*hidden_size]
    #
    # For gru_size=96:
    #     weight_ih shape = [288, 96]   (288 = 3 * 96)
    #     weight_hh shape = [288, 96]
    #     bias_ih shape   = [288]
    #     bias_hh shape   = [288]
    #
    # The "ih" stands for "input-to-hidden" (transforms the input x_t).
    # The "hh" stands for "hidden-to-hidden" (transforms the previous state h_{t-1}).
    #
    # The factor of 3 is because each gate (r, z, n) has its own rows in the
    # concatenated matrix, so the first hidden_size rows are for the reset gate,
    # the next hidden_size rows for the update gate, and the last hidden_size
    # rows for the new gate.
    #
    # The C code uses the same concatenated layout, so we simply flatten these
    # tensors in order. The C GRU implementation splits them back into gates
    # using pointer offsets: rows [0..H) for r, [H..2H) for z, [2H..3H) for n.
    #
    # PyTorch naming convention for GRU parameters:
    #     weight_ih_l0  -->  "input-to-hidden, layer 0"
    #     weight_hh_l0  -->  "hidden-to-hidden, layer 0"
    #     bias_ih_l0    -->  "input bias, layer 0"
    #     bias_hh_l0    -->  "hidden bias, layer 0"
    #
    # We export them in the order: w_ih, w_hh, b_ih, b_hh for each GRU layer.
    # This must match the ASSIGN() macro order in nanopitch.c.

    # ── Linear (Dense) Layer Weights ──
    #
    # HOW LINEAR LAYER WEIGHTS MAP TO DENSE LAYERS IN C:
    #
    # PyTorch's nn.Linear(in_features, out_features) stores:
    #     weight: shape [out_features, in_features]
    #     bias:   shape [out_features]
    #
    # The forward pass computes: output = input @ weight.T + bias
    # (Note the transpose — PyTorch stores weight as [out, in], not [in, out].)
    #
    # In C, a dense layer does: for each output neuron o:
    #     output[o] = bias[o] + sum_i(weight[o * in_features + i] * input[i])
    #
    # Since PyTorch's weight is already [out_features, in_features] and we
    # flatten in row-major order, the C code can index it as weight[o][i]
    # which equals weight[o * in_features + i] — a direct match.
    #
    # dense_vad: Linear(384, 1) -- predicts voice activity (voiced or unvoiced)

    1. User drops model.json onto the page (or clicks to select file)
    2. JavaScript reads the file with FileReader.readAsText()
    3. JSON.parse() gives us the object with metadata + weights array
    4. We malloc() space in the WASM heap for n_weights * 4 bytes (float32)
    5. We copy each weight into HEAPF32 (the WASM linear memory view):
           for (let i = 0; i < n; i++)
               HEAPF32[(ptr >> 2) + i] = data.weights[i];
    6. We call the C function nanopitch_load_weights(ptr, n, condSize, gruSize)
    7. The C code sets up pointers into this flat buffer for each layer

    The JSON format is human-readable and easy to debug, but larger than binary.
    For production, the binary format (see export_binary below) is ~3x smaller
    because raw float32 bytes are more compact than decimal text + JSON overhead.
